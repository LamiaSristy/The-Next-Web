# The-Next-Web
This project is a clone of a tech-focused magazine named, "The Next Web", which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

We used HTML & CSS, including GRID, Flex-Box and media queries. The webpage is visually responsive for all formats including mobile and for you to test this you can re-size the browser and you will see how the layout changes for differnet screen sizes.
